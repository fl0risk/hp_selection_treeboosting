This repository contains the code developed as part of my semester thesis titled "A Comparative Study of Hyperparameter Selection Methods for Tree-Boosting with Applications to Financial Data.".
The code implements different hyperparameter selection methods such as _(Random) Grid Search_, _Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes_, _Tree-structured Parzen Estimator_, _Hyperband_ and _SMAC_. 
Moreover, it provides possibilities to compare the methods for different parameter grids and search spaces, respectively.
